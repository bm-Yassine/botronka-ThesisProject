audio/ (wake word, STT, TTS)
control/ (movement, motor driver)
sensors/ (ultrasonic, IMU if you add one)
core/ (command router, trust levels, safety rules)



1) Basic interactions to implement now (v0)
- Inputs
Camera: face detected / not detected (later: known vs unknown)
Ultrasonic: distance in front
Internal health: exceptions, timeouts, low FPS, sensor failures
- Core states (emotions)
GREETING → face appears after being absent
HAPPY → everything normal (no obstacle, no error)
SUSPICIOUS → face detected but unknown (v0 = “any face” can be unknown until you add recognition)
LONELY → no face detected for X seconds
STUCK → obstacle too close for > X seconds (or later: all directions blocked)
ANGRY → error in a module (camera fail, OLED fail, sensor fail)
CURIOUS → object/face detected but confidence low
SLEEPY → idle too long
ALERT → distance suddenly drops (someone approaches fast)
- Buzzer notification events
STUCK_START (short triple beep)
ERROR (long + long)
NEW_FACE (single chirp)
TOO_CLOSE (fast beeps)
LOW_BATTERY, WAKE_WORD, TRUST_DENIED, TRUST_GRANTED
